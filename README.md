# Geowander

This project offers an engaging way to explore the world through Google Maps. It allows users to define specific latitude and longitude boundaries, creating a personalized geographical frame. Within these set bounds, the application can generate a random location, providing a surprise destination within the chosen area. Additionally, the project has a random button, which, when clicked, generates completely random coordinates. This function serves as a digital adventure tool, presenting users with unexpected locations across the globe.
